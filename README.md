# Online-Voting-System

# Project Overview
Online voting systems are complete web applications designed to facilitate a safe and effective electronic voting process. Today's age\In digital, traditional paper voting systems face many issues, including logistical difficulties, higher costs, and security issues. The project solves these issues and provides a reliable and practical digital platform that provides vote integrity while maintaining voter and system safety.
The system is developed with the main purpose of modernizing the election process, making it more accessible to voters while maintaining the highest standards of safety and transparency. This platform can be used for many different types of elections. This is the organization's small voice in larger institutional elections.

Traditional voting systems suffer from some limitations:

Logistics Issues: Physical polling stations require critical infrastructure, HR and coordination
Accessibility Questions: Voters with mobility restrictions or those living in remote locations face difficulties in participating
Cost inefficiency: Paper systems include significant costs for printing, transportation and manual calculations
Time consumption: Voting counts are manual and intense and affected by human error
Security Vulnerabilities: Physical ballot boxes can be forged and paper ballots can be lost or damaged
Environmental impact: Large amounts of paper and transportation contribute to environmental degradation
